Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset using SQL


This project involves a two-part assignment simulating a Data Scientist's role, focusing on profiling and analyzing the Yelp dataset using SQL queries. In the first part, the task is to answer questions related to data profiling and understanding, including finding total records, distinct records, checking for null values, and extracting statistical values for specific fields. The second part requires formulating inferences and analyses for a chosen research question, involving the preparation of the dataset and grading based on code readability.

For part one, the analysis includes determining the total number of records and distinct records for various tables, checking for null values in the Users table, and extracting statistical values for specific fields in different tables. Additionally, it involves listing cities with the most reviews and finding distributions of star ratings in specific cities.

In part two, the focus shifts to a role-playing scenario where the Data Scientist chooses a city and category to group businesses based on overall star ratings. Questions involve analyzing differences in distribution of hours, the number of reviews, and location data between businesses with 2-3 stars and those with 4-5 stars. The project concludes with a self-designed analysis exploring the correlation between location, business attributes, and average star ratings. The SQL queries provided showcase the analytical process and insights gained from the dataset.
